Upon opening the right TV drawer any well functioning member of society would likely experience abhorrently intense emotions at the sight of the chaos it contains, which...
can only be put into one's imagination, having not seen it, by also imagining the heat death of the universe and the epitome of entropy.
This formerly well ordered individual who's value and contribution to their community cannot be understated, would then sever all ties to this mortal plane of existence. 
In doing so they would lose their ego and surely live out the rest of what they once called their own life in the closest available mountainous region.<<wait:1>

Fortunately for us, it was a dog who opened the right TV drawer<<wait:0.2> and prompty closed it having seen nothing of value inside.
